title: "Classification of News Article Using NLP"

I am a person who is always attracted to space. To apply and improve my knowledge of Data Science and apply it in a real-world scenario, I stared with this project.

I have created this project to gain knowledge about how images are classified using machine learning algorithms. What were some challenges are faced and how did I solve that with help of different techniques. Let us discuss that.

## About the Dataset-
Using NLP By referring this you might be able to predict / classify any articles or topics to its particular class.

References to news pages collected from an web aggregator in the period from 10-March-2014 to 10-August-2014. The resources are grouped into categories that represent pages discussing the same story. News categories included in this dataset include business(b); science and technology(t); entertainment(e); and health(h).
## What it covers -
With help of this project, I was able to understand-

1: Preprocessing the text data.

2: Preprocess text data with tokenization, stopword removal etc

3: Vectorize data using Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches.

4: Apply classifiers (Logistic and Multinomial Naive Bayes) to perform multi-class classification.
